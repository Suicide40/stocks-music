# stocks-music

The idea of converting stock bids into music.

In this project I am using ticks from Gemini because it has open API. (https://www.gemini.com/)

There are variety ways of converting ticks to notes or chords, but I decided to convert price to int and get returns the
rest of the division with the 13.

Made for fun.
